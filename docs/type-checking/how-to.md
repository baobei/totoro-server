# Type Checking

This is not a fresh topic, but there still are some weird things, if the data to be checked is from another window or an iframe.

You can run it in either of the following way:

1. Run `totoro`.
2. Launch a static server (it won't work by opening it directly), and open it in browsers one by one.
